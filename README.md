# Packet Analyzer using Wireshark

This project utilizes Wireshark to capture, analyze, and visualize network packets in real time. It helps in understanding network traffic, protocols, and detecting anomalies or performance issues.

The packet analyzer captures data packets flowing through the network interface and provides detailed insights into protocol layers, packet sizes, source/destination addresses, and more.

## Features

- Real-time packet capturing
- Detailed packet inspection by protocol
- Filtering and searching packets by criteria
- Exporting packet data for further analysis

## Technologies Used

- Wireshark and its libraries (e.g., libpcap, tshark)
- Scripting languages like Python or C (specify your language)
- GUI tools for visualization (optional)

## How to Run

1. Install Wireshark and necessary dependencies.
2. Run the packet capture script or application.
3. Use filters to analyze specific traffic types.
4. Export or save capture files as needed.
